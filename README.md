Welcome to irisdemo-base-spark-iris, the code to build a docker container for Spark and IRIS!

This image is meant to be used on a docker-compose with IRIS and another notebook container such as Zeppelin. See the readmission demo for an example.

Prerequisits:
 1) Build irisdemo-base-spark-iris with: ./build.sh
 (Will pull irisdemo-base-irisdb-community from docker hub)
